The below are some of the datasets available in the internet
- [top-view-multi-person-tracking](https://github.com/ucuapps/top-view-multi-person-tracking) 
  Picture for reference:

   Issues with the Dataset
   - The height and elevation angle might be a issue
   - has weird numbers I dont know what that is 
   - The only dataset which is available but, seems like it is fitted to the people.
   - 

- [top view trained](https://universe.roboflow.com/topview/top-view-trained)
  some reference images
- best one we can use ig

	  contians the dataset of the above one too in this 
	 Looks perfect but i presume not enough data and also had data from a lot of venues thats good 
	 but cant trust it cause not in github
	- This data set is really good but most of the datasets in roboflow is not getting downloaded some issue 
	- But Can download individual photos

	 Issues again has weird numbering 
	 and everything else looks alr
	 It is fking paid but good. Can ask for it 
	  
- [**Multi-camera Multiple People Tracking (MMPTRACK)**](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=object-tracking)
	- Issues just some random website for all datasets 
	- Check these out later 
		- - **Multi-camera Multiple People Tracking (MMPTRACK)**: Over 9.6 hours of multi-camera video with dense annotations, covering diverse environments. Some sequences may feature top or angled views[5](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=object-tracking).
    
		- **PathTrack**: Over 15,000 person trajectories in 720 video sequences, suitable for tracking research[5](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=object-tracking).
		    
	- **Aerial View Human Action Detection Dataset**: Contains long, fully-annotated sequences from aerial perspectives, which can be similar to top-down views[5](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=object-tracking).\
- Shit

-  [A Systematic Deep Learning Based Overhead Tracking and Counting System Using RGB-D Remote Cameras](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/12/5503)
	- This is a paper 
	- Focuses more on counting than tracking
	- reference image:![[Pasted image 20250518045909.png]]
	- I think it has a code 
	-  But looks shite mate
